// Please note that this program is a simple infinite lopp.
// However, as the goal is not to execute the code, but to find all reachable states.
// So the infinite loop this is not a problem here, as the state never changes.
// See test/bad/4_infinite_loop.prog for an example of a real infinite loop that is not under the subject's hypothesis of a "small" number of possible states.
